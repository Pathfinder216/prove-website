      <h1>Poseidon Mk. 1</h1>
      <article>
	<h2><a href="Pics/Poseidon/Mk1.jpg"><img src="Pics/Poseidon/Mk1.jpg" /></a></h2>
	<div>
	  <p>We used PVC for the frame of Poseidon Mk. 1 because it is cheap and easy to work
	     with. We chose this shape because it had superior stability, tool mounting
	     options, and a better ability to support our vectored thruster arrangement.
	     Vectored thrusters are propellers arranged at the four corners of the ROV and
	     angled at 45 degrees. This arrangement allowed maximum maneuverability using
	     fewer thrusters.
	  </p>

	  <p>The electronics, including the camera (fig. 1), were encased in a custom-made waterproof
	     pressure housing in the center of the ROV (fig. 2).
	  </p>

	  <p>ROVs use a tether to receive power and to communicate with the surface. On the
	     surface, we had a laptop that ran the main program running the ROV. We used an
	     Xbox 360 controller to pilot the ROV, because it allowed great control and several
	     input options.
	  </p>

	  <p>After the Regional competition, we added the rotating tool mount (RTM) under the
	     ROV, which allowed the use of up to four different tools, despite only having
	     one camera. One of the tools used was a manipulator (fig. 3).

      <h1>Poseidon Mk. 2</h1>
      <article>
	<h2><a href="Pics/Poseidon/Mk2.jpg"><img src="Pics/Poseidon/Mk2.jpg" /></a></h2>
	<div>
	  <p>Our second year, we decided to do a major design overhaul. We experienced several
	     problems with Mk. 1, including (but not limited to) trouble with waterproofing,
	     slow movement, and bulky stature. We switched to a frame made of cutting board
	     (bought from Chef Depot), because it was sturdy, easy to machine, and light.
	     This allowed for a more compact and hyrdrodynamic ROV, while still providing
	     great stability and control (fig. 4).
	  </p>

	  <p>We opted to have two smaller pressure housings, because they provided better
	     stability and because we would be able to access the electronics inside more
	     easily (fig. 5). One pressure housing contained the main processing chip and the camera,
	     while the other pressure housing contained our custom-built motor controllers,
	     which control the thrusters and the manipulator.
	  </p>

	  <p>The waterproof seal on the pressure housings was achieved using two o-rings
	     sandwiched between the ends of the housings and a Lexan disc. Waterproof
	     connectors allowed wires to pass through that disc. You can see the electronics
	     placed inside one of the pressure housing in fig. 6.
	  </p>

	  <p>We did not incorporate an RTM into Poseidon Mk. 2, because we only needed a
	     manipulator to complete that year's mission tasks.

      <h1>Poseidon Mk. 3</h1>
      <article>
	<h2><a href="Pics/Poseidon/Mk3.png"><img src="Pics/Poseidon/Mk3.jpg" /></a></h2>
	<div>
	  <p>The previous year, the front of the ROV was one of the pressure housings, which
	     was located on the longer side of the ROV. For Poseidon Mk. 3, we reoriented the
	     main design for better hydrodynamics. We added a small pressure housing for the
	     camera along the short side of ROV. We added two vertical thrusters and upgraded
	     some of the rest, so that they had more power.
	  </p>

	  <p>We included an RTM in the main design, which provided access to the manipulator
	     and two other tools. The manipulator was redesigned (fig. 7 and fig. 8), due to
	     disappointing results with the previous design. The new manipulator worked
	     flawlessly.
	  </p>

	  <p>Although it may seem like not much was added or changed between Mk. 2 and Mk. 3,
	     that is not the case. Most of the changes were small or very technical, which we
	     do not feel the need to describe at this time. For more in-depth information,
	     refer to the <a href="Tech_Reports/2012.pdf">2012 Technical Report</a>, the
	     <a href="Tech_Reports/2013.pdf">2013 Technical Report</a>, and the
