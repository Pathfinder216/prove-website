	<h2>Pennsylvania ROV Engineers</h2>
	<p>
	  We are a group of high school homeschoolers. We have participated in the MATE ROV
	  Competition since the 2011-2012 school year. We learned a lot that first year and
	  have improved each year since then. Our team itself is small, consisting of about
	  6 members each year. We aren't able to build the biggest and the best ROV (Remotely
	  Operated Vehicle), but we put time into it and build ROVs that challenge the
	  competition. Our team no longer competes in the MATE ROV Competition. Check
	  out our social media pages (links in the address bar at the bottom of the page) for
	  posts on what we did while we competed.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Check out the Team page for information about this year's team members. Visit the
	  Media page for photos and videos of the team in action, both in our garage at home,
	  and at International Competitions across the country. Details about each year's ROV
	  can be found under the Poseidon tab. Finally, for budget information, check out the
	  Finance tab. Thanks for visiting!

	<h2>Marine Advanced Technology Education Center</h2>
	<p>"The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center is a national partnership of
	   organizations working to improve marine technical education and in this way help to
	   prepare America's future workforce for ocean occupations." &nbsp;&#8212; <cite>The "About" section on the 
	   <a href="http://www.marinetech.org" target="_blank">MATE website</a>.</cite>
	</p>

	<p>The MATE Center organizes the MATE ROV Competition that we have participated in since 2012.
	   The competition consists of regional competitions throughout the world, winners of which
	   are invited to an international competition held in mid-June. Each year the MATE Center
	   chooses a theme for the competition and builds a set of missions that revolve around that
	   theme.  Although the theme varies, missions typically require teams to build ROVs capable
	   of moving objects, taking measurements, and observing and identifying objects. In
	   addition, the competition requires teams to document their vehicle with a 20-page
	   technical documentation, to give a  presentation of their ROV to a panel of judges, and
	   to create a poster display.
